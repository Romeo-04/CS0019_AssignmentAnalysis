            <h2>How to Read the Diagram</h2>
            <p>Fidelity (How real?) – Do we model the true mechanics/sensors/policies?<br>
                <em>Analogy:</em> real aerodynamics vs. arcade flight.
            </p>
            <p>Resolution (How detailed?) – How many distinct states or categories do we track?<br>
                <em>Analogy:</em> photo pixels or the number of customer types.
            </p>
            <p>Scale (How big/long?) – Scope in space/time and population.<br>
                <em>Analogy:</em> map zoom (gate → terminal → nationwide) and time window (minutes → months).
            </p>
            <p>The Venn shows which dial(s) we turned up for different kinds of airport models.</p>

            <h2>F only (High Fidelity, Low Resolution, Small Scale)</h2>
            <p><strong>Example:</strong> e-Gate door/turnstile mechanism cycle model.</p>
            <p><strong>Why it lives here:</strong> It models the real mechanics of a single e-Gate, motor cycle timing,
                safety
                interlocks, sensor triggers, and failure probabilities, very accurately (<em>high fidelity</em>). It does
                not represent
                different passenger cohorts or multiple lanes, and it covers seconds per cycle rather than hours or
                terminals
                (<em>low resolution</em>, <em>small scale</em>).</p>
            <p><strong>What it answers:</strong> “What is the open/close cycle time and its variance?” “What
                availability can we expect
                (MTBF/MTTR) under continuous use?” “How long can the gate remain unlocked before a safety interlock
                engages?”</p>
            <p><strong>What it can’t answer:</strong> Queue length, required staffing, or airport-wide
                throughput, there’s no passenger
                flow here, just the device.</p>


            <h2>R only (High Resolution, low Fidelity, small Scale)</h2>
            <p><strong>Example:</strong> Micro-queue sim of one counter: dozens of passenger states but service times
                are generic.</p>
            <p><strong>Why it lives here:</strong> Lots of categories (first-timer, elderly, mask/glasses, etc.), high
                resolution, but mechanics at each step are simplified (e.g., “service time = 40 seconds” with no sensor
                physics), so fidelity is modest and the scope is just one counter, small scale.</p>
            <p><strong>What it answers:</strong> “If I prioritize elderly or first-timers, what happens to
                fairness/wait?”</p>
            <p><strong>What it can’t answer:</strong> Device or sensor limits; airport-wide knock-on effects.</p>

            <h2>S only (High Scale, low Fidelity, low Resolution)</h2>
            <p><strong>Example:</strong> Nationwide arrival forecast (passengers/day by airport; simple regression).</p>
            <p><strong>Why it lives here:</strong> Covers the whole country and long time horizons, high scale, but uses
                simple equations and few categories, low fidelity and low resolution.</p>
            <p><strong>What it answers:</strong> “How many arrivals per airport per day next month?” for high-level
                planning.</p>
            <p><strong>What it can’t answer:</strong> Minute-by-minute queues, bottlenecks, or sensor behavior.</p>

            <h2>F ∩ R (High Fidelity + High Resolution (limited Scale))</h2>
            <p><strong>Example:</strong> Model of NAIA e-Gate arrivals (our working model).</p>
            <p><strong>Why it lives here:</strong> Models true steps (scan → biometrics → watchlist) with realistic
                failure/retry logic, high fidelity, and keeps meaningful cohorts (first-time users, repeat users,
                mask/glasses, referral reasons), high resolution. Scoped to one terminal / a few flight banks, scale is
                limited.</p>
            <p><strong>What it answers:</strong> “During tonight’s wide-body bank, how many e-Gates and marshals do we
                need to keep waits under 8 minutes?”</p>
            <p><strong>What it can’t answer:</strong> Multi-airport policies or month-long trends by itself.</p>

            <h2>F ∩ S (High Fidelity + High Scale (modest Resolution))</h2>
            <p><strong>Example:</strong> NAIA airport grid-power model aggregated by terminals.</p>
            <p><strong>Why it lives here:</strong> Keeps real physics (power demand/thermal loads), high fidelity, and
                spans multiple terminals and long periods, high scale. Aggregates users/loads (few categories), modest
                resolution.</p>
            <p><strong>What it answers:</strong> “If Terminal 3 adds six e-Gate banks, what’s the peak load and backup
                power requirement this summer?”</p>
            <p><strong>What it can’t answer:</strong> Per-passenger queue behavior or detailed referral reasons.</p>

            <h2>R ∩ S (High Resolution + High Scale (modest Fidelity))</h2>
            <p><strong>Example:</strong> Airport-wide simulation of all transfer passengers across all terminals.</p>
            <p><strong>Why it lives here:</strong> Tracks many passengers and paths (transfer security, immigration,
                people-movers) across all terminals and an entire day/week, high resolution and high scale. Checkpoint
                mechanics are black-boxed as service-time distributions, modest fidelity.</p>
            <p><strong>What it answers:</strong> “What’s the missed-connection rate by bank?” “How many
                transfer-security lanes to open from 17:30–19:00?”</p>
            <p><strong>What it can’t answer:</strong> Scanner physics or biometric thresholds.</p>

            <h2>F ∩ R ∩ S (All three high (the center))</h2>
            <p><strong>Example:</strong> Full implementation of NAIA e-Gate arrivals for everyone & anytime.</p>
            <p><strong>Why it lives here:</strong> True-to-process (F), fine-grained per passenger (R), and
                airport-/multi-day scale (S).</p>
            <p><strong>What it promises:</strong> End-to-end “everything at once” answers.</p>
            <p><strong>Trade-off:</strong> Data-hungry, compute-heavy, hard to calibrate, rare in practice unless you
                have sustained data and engineering support.</p>

            <h2>Why is it important to know the differences?</h2>
            <p><strong>Push Fidelity high</strong> → you trust mechanics but may lose breadth or detail.</p>
            <p><strong>Push Resolution high</strong> → you see fairness and cohort effects but must simplify physics or
                scope.</p>
            <p><strong>Push Scale high</strong> → you plan resources broadly but won’t capture second-by-second
                realities.</p>
